The episode begins with a crisis in the Hong family, who are evicted from their palace and narrowly escape being photographed by reporters. Luckily, Hyun Woo (Kim Soo Hyun) appears just in time to rescue them and takes them to his countryside home to hide temporarily. Although grateful, Hae In (Kim Ji Won) expresses her desire to leave soon as she feels uncomfortable living in her ex-husband's house. The wealthy family faces several challenges adapting to the ordinary lifestyle, while Hae In quickly adjusts and even helps with household chores, impressing her mother-in-law with her cooking skills. Meanwhile, at the Hong family palace, Eun Sung discovers that his mother has kicked out Hae In's family, causing him great shock and sadness.

Hae In unexpectedly falls ill, but she hides her condition from everyone, causing concern for her family. Her mother, however, dismisses it as unimportant. Hyun Woo quickly rushes home upon hearing the news, but Hae In is more concerned about his work than her health. Eun Sung knows about Hae In's illness and is frantic to find a cure, but he cannot do anything since he is not her guardian.  In order to bring Hae In back, Eun Sung defied his mother's words, secretly took the chairman Hong out of the hospital, disregarding the fact that his health was already very weak.

Queen of Tears tập 9 tập trung vào cuộc chiến giải cứu gia đình vợ của Hyun Woo.

Queen of Tears (Nữ Hoàng Nước Mắt) tập 9 tiếp tục có hàng loạt những tình tiết vừa hài hước vừa kịch tính thế nhưng rating tập này lại giảm nhẹ xuống còn 15,5% (so với 16,1% của tập 8). Tập 9 mở đầu với cuộc khủng hoảng của gia đình họ Hong. Họ bị tống cổ ra khỏi chính dinh thự của mình, suýt nữa còn bị phóng viên ghi lại khoảnh khắc ê chề, may mắn là Hyun Woo (Kim Soo Hyun) xuất hiện kịp lúc và giải cứu cả nhà. Anh đưa tất cả đến nhà mình ở quê để tạm trốn trong khoảng thời gian này. Dù rất biết ơn Hyun Woo nhưng Hae In (Kim Ji Won) lại nói rằng mình sẽ sớm dọn đi nơi khác. Cô cảm thấy không thoải mái khi ở nhà chồng cũ. Gia đình tài phiệt cũng gặp không ít rắc rối bởi không quen lối sống của người thường. Trong khi đó Hae In lại nhanh chóng thích nghi, cô còn chủ động phụ giúp việc nhà và rất hào hứng khi thấy mẹ chồng cũ nấu nướng một cách chuyên nghiệp.



Cùng lúc này, ở dinh thự của nhà họ Hong, Eun Sung phát hiện ra mẹ mình đã đuổi cổ gia đình Hae In, điều này khiến anh rất sốc và xót xa. Dù đã chiếm tập đoàn Queens nhưng Eun Sung thực sự yêu Hae In và thề sẽ đưa Hae In về bằng mọi giá. Anh cũng thể hiện thái độ thù hằn với chính mẹ ruột của mình - bà Seul Hee. Eun Sung không ngờ rằng Hae In đang ở nhà của Hyun Woo, cô còn phát hiện ra Hyun Woo chính là cậu nam sinh trung học mình từng gặp và rung động hồi cấp 3.

Hyun Woo vẫn phải đi làm dù tập đoàn Queens đã đổi chủ, anh thậm chí còn diễn cảnh nhân viên ngoan ngoãn gọi Eun Sung là chủ tịch và hứa mình sẽ sớm xin nghỉ việc. Thực tế anh chỉ đang âm thầm điều tra, phát hiện ra rằng Eun Sung đã chiếm tập đoàn một cách bất hợp pháp và đang lên kế hoạch để gậy ông đập lưng ông.

Hae In bất ngờ phát bệnh, bị ngất và lần này cả nhà đã phát hiện ra. Thế nhưng cô vẫn giấu bệnh tình của mình, trong khi cả nhà đều lo lắng thì mẹ của Hae In lại coi thường tình trạng của con gái. Hyun Woo cũng tức tốc từ chỗ làm chạy về nhà vì lo cho vợ tuy nhiên Hae In lại không quan tâm đến chuyện sức khỏe mà lập tức hỏi Hyun Woo đã làm gì ở công ty.

Eun Sung đã biết bệnh tình của Hae In. Anh ta điên loạn vì muốn tìm cách chữa bệnh cho người mình yêu nhưng không thể vì không phải người giám hộ. Để có thể đưa Hae In trở lại, Eun Sung đã cãi lời mẹ, âm thầm đưa chủ tịch Hong khỏi phòng bệnh, bất chấp việc sức khỏe của ông đang rất yếu. Không chỉ vậy, Eun Sung còn sớm tìm ra chỗ ở của Hae In, bất ngờ đến gặp cô trong khi Hyun Woo thì đang bị chặn đánh giữa đường vì một vụ kiện tụng liên quan đến Queens.
