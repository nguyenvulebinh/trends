[ This is what the decadent nightlife of New York City looks like.](https://www.businessinsider.de/leben/international-panorama/so-sieht-das-dekadente-nachtleben-von-new-york-city-aus/)

> The nightlife in New York City has recovered unevenly from the Covid-19 pandemic, with some restaurants and bars thriving while others continue to struggle. While consumer sentiment is improving, inflation remains a concern for many in the hospitality industry. Restaurants are facing rising food costs, labor shortages, and tough decisions to stay afloat. The economic mood may be over for the general public, but there is still a long way to go for those who are barely making ends meet or just starting to save. The last Golden Age of the city was both a time of growth and vitality and a time of corruption and inequality, serving as a warning for the country. Observing inflation after the pandemic has revealed structural weaknesses in society, with wealthy New Yorkers enjoying new dining rooms and glittering new skyscrapers while others experience trauma from record-high rents and evictions.

 New Yorkers are starting to enjoy their lives again. However, corruption and inequality still persist and continue to affect those who cannot afford luxury. This is a machine translation of an article from our US colleagues at Business Insider, reviewed by a real editor. The bars and restaurants that make New York City's nightlife shine have never stopped partying. While the rest of the country - businesses, investors, economists, normal people - spent 2023 in a state of fear waiting for a recession that never came, the bastions of gastronomic elite in New York City have survived the pandemic louder, prouder, and more extravagantly than ever. Here, it's like ancient Rome. And if there is a legalized form of popular blood sport in New York City, then it's the restaurant business.

Between status and technology
Dining in the city's most coveted restaurants is an exercise in the ability to endure rejection. In old New York, money and fame were the currencies that eventually got you a table wherever you wanted. But the internet and reservation apps have eliminated personal contact when making reservations and turned the search for a coveted table into the shortest video game ever. Status still matters, but tech-savvy people who have programmed bots to search for reservations have added a disturbing new level. Recently, I met a man who was constantly trying to get a table for five people at a trendy new restaurant. He was very proud of himself for having accomplished this. I wasn't.

The surge in demand has not meant that everything has been easy. Food prices have steadily increased. The tight labor market makes it difficult to find and retain staff. And, of course, there is the relentless rise in rents in New York City. Yet, new restaurants continue to open. And not just any restaurants, but luxurious, maximalist restaurants with ingredients that are as international as the city itself.

New York's nightlife resembles the Roaring Twenties
The new wave of restaurants also stands in stark contrast to an earlier era of New York gastronomy. After the financial crisis, the city put on a black turtleneck à la Steve Jobs and presented everything with clear lines and understated elegance. Now it has returned to something reminiscent of the Gilded Age - a maximalist mob-wife aesthetic that orders "more with a side of much more." Even the city's bars have become rococo. Is there anything bigger...  A vote of confidence for the economic upturn in New York in the form of the opening of a Tiki bar, which has the appearance of a dive, decorated with flowers like at a wedding in the Grand Prospect Hall, and urging guests to pay 25 US dollars (approximately 23 euros) for a cocktail named "Tarman"? Despite the city's dazzling victory over the pandemic and the glorious return of food as Gotham's favorite pastime, there is still a significant divide between the haves and have-nots. As the pandemic emergency subsided, our strange new economy revealed the dramatic difference between Americans who believe they can handle an inflation shock and those who cannot. It therefore makes sense that Manhattan, where income disparities are greater than in any other district in the country, was at the forefront of this American life revolution. It is a granite island full of hungry wealthy people looking for something to do. The list ranges from Wall Street bankers and tech executives to the rich of the generation known as the famous and beautiful. In a country plagued by recession concerns, New York City's top politicians couldn't care less whether they are gilded. Also read: So many millionaires there are in the USA - and in these cities they live The Big Apple strikes back The opening of a new business is an act of hope everywhere. Opening a restaurant even more so. Opening a restaurant in New York City requires the faith of a medieval saint. For an industry that was already on the brink, the pandemic seemed like a catastrophic blow. If it weren't for food delivery apps, creative outdoor seating arrangements, and the stubborn refusal of many New Yorkers to work in their home kitchens, we might have lost even more establishments than we did. In this city, a non-registered, unmarked hole-in-the-wall serving first-class Xinjiang noodles can be just as much a target as Tavern on the Green - and the food is probably better. Even in this chaos, New York is a city that embraces bizarre circumstances, and as the pandemic took hold, it became its superpower. "I think the city and New Yorkers are so different and so unimpressed by this situation. Don't you remember when a million people were eating outside?", said Jennifer Sasue, a restaurateur from Manhattan. Sasue opened her first restaurant, Fish Cheeks, in 2017, and it soon became a fixture in the city center. During the pandemic, Fish Cheeks, like other restaurants, survived by expanding takeout and setting up outdoor seating. Sasue said that after a lull during the lockdowns, revenues returned to their normal cycle in the restaurant business in the city: a slow start to the year, a busy spring, a slower summer, and then total madness from fall and through the holiday season. Every crazy week sees the opening of new, popular restaurants. The time of decadence Since New Yorkers have pushed aside their fear of recession by simply spending as much money as if it would never come - especially on food,  Drinks and entertainment. According to a Mastercard report, spending on nightlife at the end of March 2023 was eleven percent higher than pre-pandemic levels. It's not hard to understand why. Few people in the country lived as close together during the pandemic as New Yorkers did. As the pandemic ended, they bet on the return of institutions that form the backbone of urban culture. The rest of the country could hold onto their weak vibes. For New York City, encountering death meant a time of decadence. "I feel like we're back to where we were before the pandemic. Now people are spending more than ever, and restaurants are opening up especially," said Sasue. "New hot restaurants are opening every damn week." Expensive food, exclusivity, and lots of money. That's what the city is doing now. Give in to it. The club-restaurants are back, and Generation Z - a generation that claims to not like fun - is there in full force. The city's bistros are responding to this enthusiasm by expanding their offerings. New York chefs have somehow made hard-boiled eggs taste like caviar, and LCD Soundsystem frontman James Murphy has a restaurant that sells them for $25 (about €23). Of course, these eggs come with caviar. There's caviar everywhere. At Coqodaq, a newly opened Korean fried chicken restaurant that looks like a church in Las Vegas, you can order a perfectly crispy nugget with caviar for $28 (almost €26). That will cost you and all you need to get through a meal while watching hordes of Tiktok food influencers completely lose their minds. As the kids would say, "Nature heals." The city's elite consist of the same Wall Street workhorses, fashion and public relations power brokers, trust fund babies (from home and abroad), fancy people, quasi-creative advertising types, total tech nerds, and always wide-awake fixers. But their taste has changed. There are plenty of clubs and restaurants that are only accessible to members. The new Aman New York has a private club with a membership fee of $200,000 (about €184,500). The guys who brought us Carbone have a private restaurant named ZZ's with a membership fee of $20,000 (about €18,450) and an annual membership fee of $10,000 (about €9,200). Aren't people thinking about the recession at all? There are the Casas - Cruz and Cipriani (both private clubs that are not related) - and the old Soho House headquarters, which has grown to four locations in the city. Private clubs that distinguish between the haves and have-nots were a feature of the first Gilded Age. Now we're back here, except that the most sought-after restaurants almost exclusively function as clubs. You know someone, wait for hours, play with the digital reservation system, beg (maybe). Then you might get a spot at a reasonable mealtime, like 9:30 pm (if you're lucky) or 5:30 pm (if you've given up on the fun). It seems like people aren't thinking too much about the recession.  Reflecting, I think they're talking about it, but their behavior doesn't reflect it. Sasue opened her second concept, the Bangkok Supper Club, in the West Village in 2023. It was immediately praised by critics and became so successful that a reservation became a status symbol exclusive to NYC. "If I look at where I am," Sasue told me, "it seems like people aren't thinking much about the recession. I think they're talking about it, but their behavior doesn't reflect it." The nightlife in New York is a show A city should consider itself lucky if it has two or three ethereal dining rooms that are so transporting that everything you see or touch feels precious. In recent years, New York has consistently opened such spaces. Most recently, the renowned chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten opened Four Twenty-Five on Park Avenue. There, one feels as if they're dining on a crystal cloud. It's a place where you can observe a classic New York Uptown crowd - an older group of ultra-professionals, mothers and fathers on a date, women who have enough money but too much self-confidence to be on "Real Housewives," wealth managers who drink at the opulent bar after a long night at the office. For these people, elegance in New York's nightlife is a must. Not all of New York City's nightlife aims to make things fancy. Some of it is simply theatrical and entertaining. At Paradise Lost in the East Village, guests are transported to a Tiki bar on a choppy beach near the capital of Hell. This works because the drinks are a show in themselves. The Saturn, an old gin cocktail that won the IBA championship in 1967, is smoked with dry ice. And when you order the Lady of the Beasts, you experience what the bar calls "fire and show." Bongo drums echo through the bar as your server presents your cocktail in a sea of flames. The Lady is just one of a few cocktails on the menu that come with all the drama. If the US economy has a hard landing, NYC will have to endure it with a small hangover. After what the city has been through, it will be worth it. The full vibespace of New York nightlife A rundown of the shimmering restaurants and competitive cocktail bars in New York City is, of course, an incomplete picture of how the city is recovering. The pandemic was a harsh lesson in how an inflation shock affects the wealthy much less than everyone else. And that creates complex vibrations. According to TouchBistro, a company that provides point-of-sale services to restaurants, restaurant profit margins in New York in 2023 are at an average of 9.2 percent, down from 10.1 percent in 2022 and just below the national average of 9.3 percent. Restaurant operators reported that they spent 43 percent more on food in 2023 than in 2022. That's the highest increase across the board.  Country. While employers in other sectors of the economy are regaining control, the personnel fluctuation in NYC restaurants in the year 2023 was 31 percent. The average turnover rate in the country was 28 percent. Every restaurant is faced with these issues, but the ability of businesses to deal with rising costs while keeping customers is quite different. A survey conducted by the New York City Hospitality Alliance in December found that 37 percent of respondents had a positive outlook on future business revenue. 30 percent were pessimistic about the future and another 20 percent were unsure.

"The restaurants and bars in New York City are recovering unevenly from the Covid-19 pandemic, which has been going on for almost four years," said Andrew Rigie. He is the CEO of the New York City Hospitality Alliance. "While some have recovered and others are still struggling." The hospitality industry is a mirror of the city. The wealthy enjoy new dining rooms and glittering new skyscrapers. The have-nots experience the trauma of a record number of evictions, especially in Brooklyn and the Bronx, and the pressure of record-high rents. No one seems to have an answer to New York's housing crisis. The vacancy rate for rental apartments in 2023 was 1.4 percent. A healthy rate is between five and eight percent. Nationwide, the number of restaurants is growing. Sales reached a seasonally adjusted value of 95.01 billion US dollars (approximately 87.7 billion euros) in January. This is an increase of 0.7 percent compared to December and the eleventh consecutive month of growth. But this does not mean that the mood is good. 97 percent of restaurant owners are concerned about rising food costs, according to a survey by the National Restaurant Association. 38 percent say they did not make any money last year. That's a lot of have-nots. In a time when food prices at best fluctuate and workers are hard to come by, most of the hospitality industry has to make tough decisions. As Corey Mintz argues in this publication, we dislike what is necessary to save restaurants - more self-service, higher prices. But we may not have any other choice. I don't care how often the Nasdaq reaches new highs. That doesn't create a good mood. The last Golden Age of the city was also a time of growth and vitality, as well as a time of corruption and inequality. Restaurants are struggling financially, partly because their guests are also struggling financially. Yes, the rest of the country is starting to see what New York City has experienced: The worst is over. The consumer sentiment index of the University of Michigan has improved significantly in the last two months. Inflation expectations are also improving further. These are fantastic news for the country. But as analysts at UBS point out in a recently published customer letter, this does not necessarily mean that we feel good just because things are not bad. "These are encouraging developments and  The mood is likely to improve further if deflation continues and the Fed lowers interest rates, while real incomes continue to rise, according to UBS analysts. In other words, the economic mood may be over for the general public, but there is still a long way to go for the mood. Corruption and inequality are painful with inflation, but they are catastrophic for people who are barely making ends meet or just starting to save a little. In a highly embarrassing interview, the CEO of WK Kellogg, Gary Pilnick, seemed enthusiastic when he said that his company's message of eating cereal for dinner was "really well received." "Eating cereal for dinner is something that is probably more trendy now, and we expect it to continue as the consumer is under pressure," he said. Since 1978, CEO salaries have skyrocketed by 1460 percent, mainly due to equity-based compensation. When prices rise dramatically, those who can afford it notice and feel it, but they don't. Those who cannot afford it seem to be making Gary Pilnick's day. If a pandemic cannot defeat New York City and its nightlife, a small inflation surely will not either. However, it will reveal the structural weaknesses of our society. The last Golden Age of the city was both a time of growth and vitality and a time of corruption and inequality. It was a warning for this city and the whole country. Observing inflation after the pandemic is also a warning. It showed how it looks when the American economy experiences a short, intense shock. And that looks like wealthy New Yorkers eating caviar while poorer Americans eat cereal.

Die New Yorker fangen wieder an, ihr Leben wieder zu genießen. Aber Korruption und Ungleichheit sind immer noch vorhanden.

Die New Yorker Gastronomie hat ein neues Goldenes Zeitalter mit luxuriösen, maximalistischen Restaurants mit dekadenten Zutaten erlebt, die so international sind wie die Stadt selbst. Carl Godfrey for BI

Nach Ende der Pandemie und Beim Abflachen der Inflation fangen die New Yorker an, ihr Leben wieder zu genießen. Die Restaurants sind voll, in den Clubs dröhnen die Shows und die Reichen geben ihr Geld aus. Aber Korruption und Ungleichheit sind immer noch da und verfolgen die, die sich den Luxus nicht leisten können.

Dies ist eine maschinelle Übersetzung eines Artikels unserer US-Kollegen von Business Insider. Er wurde automatisiert übersetzt und von einem echten Redakteur überprüft.

Die Bars und Restaurants, die New York Citys Nachtleben zum Strahlen bringen, haben nie aufgehört zu feiern. Während der Rest des Landes — Unternehmen, Investoren, Wirtschaftsexperten, normale Menschen — das Jahr 2023 in einem Zustand der Angst verbrachte und auf eine Rezession wartete, die nie kam, haben die Bastionen der gastronomischen Elite von New York City die Pandemie lauter, stolzer und extravaganter denn je überstanden.

Hier ist es wie im alten Rom. Und wenn es in New York City eine legalisierte Form des populären Blutsports gibt, dann ist es das Restaurantgeschäft.

Zwischen Status und Technik

In den begehrtesten Restaurants zu speisen ist eine Übung in der Fähigkeit, Ablehnung zu ertragen. Im alten New York waren Geld und Bekanntheitsgrad die Währungen, mit denen man schließlich einen Platz bekam, wo immer man wollte. Aber das Internet und Reservierungs-Apps haben den persönlichen Kontakt bei der Reservierung abgeschafft und die Suche nach einem begehrten Tisch in das kürzeste Videospiel aller Zeiten verwandelt.

Der Status spricht immer noch, aber Technikfreaks, die Bots programmiert haben, um nach Reservierungen zu suchen, haben eine beunruhigende neue Ebene hinzugefügt. Kürzlich traf ich einen Mann, der ständig um einen Tisch für fünf Personen in einem schicken neuen Restaurant krabbelt. Er war sehr stolz auf sich, dass er das geschafft hat. Ich war es nicht.

Der Nachfrageschub bedeutet nicht, dass alles einfach gewesen ist. Die Lebensmittelpreise sind stetig gestiegen. Der heiße Arbeitsmarkt macht es schwer, Arbeitskräfte zu finden und zu halten. Und natürlich gibt es den unaufhaltsamen Anstieg der Mieten in New York City. Dennoch sind immer wieder neue Restaurants hinzugekommen. Und zwar nicht nur irgendwelche Restaurants, sondern luxuriöse, maximalistische Restaurants mit Zutaten, die so international sind wie die Stadt selbst.

New Yorks Nachtleben ähnelt den goldenen Zwanziger

Die neue Welle von Restaurants steht auch im krassen Gegensatz zu der früheren Ära der New Yorker Gastronomie. Nach der Finanzkrise zog sich die Stadt einen schwarzen Rollkragenpulli à la Steve Jobs an und präsentierte alles mit klaren Linien und geschätztem Understatement. Jetzt ist sie zu etwas zurückgekehrt, das eher an das Goldene Zeitalter erinnert — eine maximalistische Mob-Wife-Ästhetik, die „mehr mit einer Seite von viel mehr“ bestellt.

Auch die Bars der Stadt sind zum Rokoko übergegangen. Gibt es ein größeres Vertrauensvotum für den wirtschaftlichen Aufschwung New Yorks als die Eröffnung einer Tiki-Bar, die wie eine Spelunke wirkt, Blumen wie bei einer Hochzeit in der Grand Prospect Hall aufhängt und die Gäste auffordert, 25 US-Dollar (umgerechnet etwa 23 Euro) für einen Cocktail namens „Tarman“ zu bezahlen?

Trotz des strahlenden Sieges der Stadt über die Pandemie und der glorreichen Rückkehr des Essens als Gothams liebster Freizeitbeschäftigung gibt es immer noch eine große Kluft zwischen den Besitzenden und den Habenichtsen. Als der Pandemie-Notstand abebbte, offenbarte unsere seltsame neue Wirtschaft den dramatischen Unterschied zwischen Amerikanern, die glauben, mit einem Inflationsschock umgehen zu können und denen, die das nicht können.

Es macht also Sinn, dass Manhattan, wo die Einkommensunterschiede größer sind als in jedem anderen Bezirk des Landes, die Vorhut dieser amerikanischen Lebensrevolution war. Es ist eine Granitinsel voller hungriger reicher Menschen, die etwas zu tun haben wollen. Die Liste fängt bei Wall-Street-Banker und Tech-Führungskräfte und endet bei den reichen Menschen der Generation, die Berühmten und Schönen. In einem Land, das von Rezessionssorgen geplagt wird, ist es den Spitzenpolitikern in New York City im Guten wie im Schlechten scheißegal, ob sie vergoldet werden.

Der Big Apple beißt zurück

Die Eröffnung eines neuen Unternehmens ist überall ein Akt der Hoffnung. Die eines Restaurants noch mehr. Die Eröffnung eines Restaurants in New York City erfordert den Glauben eines mittelalterlichen Heiligen. Für eine Branche, die ohnehin schon auf Messers Schneide stand, schien die Pandemie ein katastrophaler Schlag zu sein. Gäbe es nicht Liefer-Apps, kreative Sitzgelegenheiten im Freien und die hartnäckige Weigerung vieler New Yorker, sich in ihre Wohnungsküchen einzuarbeiten, hätten wir vielleicht noch mehr Lokale verloren, als wir schon hatten.

In dieser Stadt kann ein nicht verzeichnetes, nicht gekennzeichnetes Hole-in-the-Wall, das erstklassige Xinjiang-Nudeln serviert, genauso ein Ziel sein wie das Tavern on the Green — und das Essen ist wahrscheinlich besser. Selbst in diesem Chaos ist New York eine Stadt, die sich auf bizarre Umstände einlässt und als die Pandemie um sich griff, wurde das zu ihrer Supermacht.

„Ich glaube, die Stadt und die New Yorker sind so anders und so unbeeindruckt von dieser Situation. Erinnert ihr euch noch an die Zeit, als eine Million Menschen draußen aßen?“, sagte Jennifer Sasue, eine Gastronomin aus Manhattan.

Sasue eröffnete ihr erstes Restaurant, Fish Cheeks, im Jahr 2017, und schon bald wurde es zu einer festen Größe in der Innenstadt. Während der Pandemie überlebte Fish Cheeks wie andere Restaurants auch, indem es den Imbissbetrieb ausweitete und Sitzplätze im Freien einrichtete. Sasue sagte, dass nach einer Flaute während der Sperrungen die Einnahmen wieder in den normalen Zyklus des Restaurantgeschäfts in der Stadt zurückfielen: ein langsamer Start ins Jahr, ein geschäftiger Frühling, ein langsamerer Sommer und dann die totale Manie ab Herbst und während der Ferienzeit.

In jeder verrückten Woche werden neue, angesagte Restaurants eröffnet.

Die Zeit der Dekadenz

Seitdem haben die New Yorker die Angst vor einer Rezession dadurch verdrängt, dass sie einfach so viel Geld ausgeben, als würde sie nie kommen — vor allem für Essen, Getränke und Unterhaltung. Einem Bericht von Mastercard zufolge lagen die Ausgaben für das Nachtleben Ende März 2023 um elf Prozent über dem Niveau vor der Pandemie. Es ist nicht schwer zu verstehen, warum.

Nur wenige Menschen im Land lebten während der Pandemie auf so engem Raum wie die New Yorker. Als die Pandemie vorbei war, setzten sie alles auf die Rückkehr der Institutionen, die das Rückgrat der städtischen Kultur bilden. Der Rest des Landes konnte seine schwachen Vibes behalten. Für New York City bedeutete die Begegnung mit dem Tod eine Zeit der Dekadenz.

„Ich habe das Gefühl, wir sind wieder da, wo wir vor der Pandemie waren. Jetzt geben die Leute mehr denn je Geld aus, und vor allem machen wieder Restaurants auf“, sagte Sasue. „Jede verdammte Woche werden neue, heiße Restaurants eröffnet.“

Teures Essen, Exklusivität und viel Geld

Das ist es also, was die Stadt jetzt tut. Lassen Sie sich darauf ein. Die Clubsteraunts sind zurück, und die Generation Z — eine Generation, die behauptet, keinen Spaß zu mögen — ist dort in voller Stärke zu sehen. Die Bistros der Stadt reagieren auf diesen Enthusiasmus, indem sie ihr Angebot aufstocken. New Yorker Chefköche haben hart gekochte Eier irgendwie verjascht, und LCD Soundsystem-Frontmann James Murphy hat ein Restaurant, das sie für 25 US-Dollar (etwa 23 Euro) verkauft.

Natürlich sind diese Eier mit Kaviar bestückt. Es gibt überall Kaviar. Im Coqodaq, einem gerade eröffneten koreanischen Brathähnchen-Restaurant, das aussieht wie eine Kirche in Las Vegas, können Sie ein perfekt knuspriges Nugget mit Kaviar bestellen. Das kostet 28 US-Dollar (fast 26 Euro) und alles, was man braucht, um eine Mahlzeit durchzustehen, während man Rudeln von Tiktok-Food-Influencern dabei zusieht, wie sie völlig den Verstand verlieren.

Wie die Kinder sagen würden: „Die Natur heilt.“ Die Wohlhabenden der Stadt bestehen aus denselben Arbeitstieren der Wall Street, Mode- und Public-Relations-Power-Brokern, Treuhandfonds-Babys (aus dem In- und Ausland), schicken Leuten, Quasi-Kreativen der Werbung, totalen Tech-Nerds und geradlinigen, nie schlafenden Strippenziehern. Aber ihr Geschmack hat sich geändert. Clubs und Restaurants, die nur für Mitglieder zugänglich sind, gibt es zuhauf. Das neue Aman New York hat einen privaten Club mit einer Aufnahmegebühr von 200.000 US-Dollar (etw, 184.500 Euro). Die Jungs, die uns Carbone brachten, haben ein privates Restaurant namens ZZ’s mit einer Aufnahmegebühr von 20.000 US-Dollar (knapp 18.450 Euro) und einer Jahresmitgliedschaft von 10.000 US-Dollar (also 9200 Euro).

Denken die Leute gar nicht über die Rezession nach?

Es gibt die Casas — Cruz und Cipriani (beides Privatclubs, die nicht miteinander verwandt sind) — und das alte Stammhaus Soho House, das auf vier Standorte in der Stadt angewachsen ist. Private Clubs, die den Raum zwischen den Besitzenden und den Besitzlosen abgrenzen, waren ein Merkmal des ersten Gilded Age. Jetzt sind wir wieder hier, nur dass die begehrtesten Restaurants fast ausschließlich als Clubs funktionieren. Man kennt jemanden, wartet stundenlang, spielt mit dem digitalen Reservierungssystem, bettelt (vielleicht). Dann bekommt man vielleicht einen Platz zu einer vernünftigen Essenszeit, etwa um 21:30 Uhr (wenn man Glück hat) oder 17:30 Uhr (wenn man den Spaß aufgegeben hat).

Es scheint, als würden die Leute nicht so viel über die Rezession nachdenken. Ich glaube, sie reden darüber, aber ihr Verhalten sagt das nicht aus.

Sasue eröffnete ihr zweites Konzept, den Bangkok Supper Club, im West Village im Jahr 2023. Es wurde sofort von der Kritik gelobt und war so erfolgreich, dass eine Reservierung zu einem Statussymbol wurde, das es nur in NYC gibt.

„Wenn ich mir anschaue, wo ich bin“, sagte mir Sasue. „Es scheint, als ob die Leute nicht so viel über die Rezession nachdenken. Ich glaube, sie reden darüber, aber ihr Verhalten sagt das nicht aus.“

Das Nachtleben in New York ist eine Show

Eine Stadt kann sich glücklich schätzen, wenn sie zwei oder drei Speisesäle hat, die ätherisch genug sind, um einen in eine Welt zu versetzen, in der alles, was man sieht oder berührt, kostbar ist. In den letzten Jahren hat New York diese Räume in einem stetigen Rhythmus eröffnet. Zuletzt eröffnete der berühmte Küchenchef Jean-Georges Vongerichten das Four Twenty-Five in der Park Avenue. Dort fühlt man sich so, als würde man auf einer Kristallwolke speisen.

Es ist ein Ort, an dem man ein ganz klassisches New Yorker Uptown-Publikum beobachten kann. Eine ältere Gruppe von Ultraprofis, Mutter und Vater bei einem Date, Frauen, die genug Geld, aber zu viel Selbstbewusstsein haben, um bei „Real Housewives“ mitzumachen, Geldmanager, die nach einer langen Nacht im Büro (ja, sie gehen ins Büro) an der prächtigen Bar trinken. Für diese Leute muss die Eleganz im Nachtleben New Yorks immer gegeben sein.

Nicht das gesamte Nachtleben in New York City ist darauf ausgerichtet, die Dinge schick zu machen. Manches davon ist einfach nur theatralisch und unterhaltsam. Im East Village versetzt das Paradise Lost seine Gäste in eine Tiki-Bar an einem kabbeligen Strand in der Nähe der Hauptstadt der Hölle. Das funktioniert, weil die Drinks eine regelrechte Show sind. Der Saturn, ein alter Gin-Cocktail, der 1967 die IBA-Meisterschaft gewann, wird mit Trockeneis geraucht.

Und wenn ihr die Lady of the Beasts bestellt, erlebt ihr das, was die Bar „Feuer und Show“ nennt. Bongo-Trommeln schallen durch die Bar und euer Kellner präsentiert euch den Cocktail in einem Flammenmeer. Der Lady ist nur einer der wenigen Cocktails auf der Karte, die mit all dem Drama einhergehen. Wenn die US-Wirtschaft eine harte Landung hinlegt, wird NYC das mit einem kleinen Kater erleben müssen. Nach dem, was die Stadt durchgemacht hat, wird es das wert gewesen sein.

Der volle Vibespace im New Yorker Nachtleben

Eine Übersicht über die schillerndsten Restaurants und wettbewerbsfähigsten Cocktailbars in New York City ist natürlich ein unvollständiges Bild davon, wie sich die Stadt erholt. Die Pandemie war eine heftige Lektion darin, wie ein Inflationsschock die Wohlhabenden viel weniger trifft als alle anderen. Und das sorgt für komplexe Schwingungen.

Einem Bericht von TouchBistro zufolge, einem Unternehmen, das Restaurants Kassendienste anbietet, liegen die Gewinnspannen von Restaurants in New York im Jahr 2023 bei durchschnittlich 9,2 Prozent, gegenüber 10,1 Prozent im Jahr 2022 und knapp unter dem nationalen Durchschnitt von 9,3 Prozent. Die Betreiber von Restaurants gaben an, dass sie im Jahr 2023 43 Prozent mehr für Lebensmittel ausgaben als 2022. Das ist der höchste Anstieg im ganzen Land. Und während Arbeitgeber in anderen Bereichen der Wirtschaft wieder die Oberhand gewinnen, lag die Personalfluktuation in NYC-Restaurants im Jahr 2023 bei 31 Prozent. Die durchschnittliche Fluktuationsrate im Land lag bei 28 Prozent.

Jedes Restaurant ist mit diesen Problemen konfrontiert, aber die Fähigkeit der Unternehmen, mit den steigenden Kosten umzugehen und gleichzeitig die Kunden zu halten, ist sehr unterschiedlich. Eine im Dezember von der New York City Hospitality Alliance durchgeführte Umfrage ergab, dass 37 Prozent der Befragten den künftigen Geschäftseinnahmen positiv gegenüberstehen. 30 Prozent blickten pessimistisch in die Zukunft und weitere 20 Prozent sich unsicher fühlen.

Ein Großteil der New Yorker kann den Luxus im Nachtleben nicht genießen

„Die Restaurants und Bars in New York City erholen sich fast vier Jahre nach dem Ausbruch von Covid-19 ungleichmäßig von der Pandemie“, sagte Andrew Rigie. Er ist der Geschäftsführer der New York City Hospitality Alliance. „Während sich einige erholt haben und andere immer noch kämpfen.“

Das Gaststättengewerbe ist ein Spiegel der Stadt. Die Wohlhabenden freuen sich über neue Speisesäle und glitzernde neue Hochhäuser. Die Habenichtse erleben das Trauma einer Rekordzahl von Zwangsräumungen, insbesondere in Brooklyn und der Bronx und den Druck rekordhoher Mieten. Niemand scheint eine Antwort auf die New Yorker Wohnungskrise zu haben. Der Leerstand von Mietwohnungen bis 2023 ist auf 1,4 Prozeht gesunken ist. Als gesund gilt eine Quote zwischen fünf und acht Prozent.

Landesweit wächst die Zahl der Restaurants insgesamt. Die Umsätze erreichten im Januar einen saisonbereinigten Wert von 95,01 Milliarden US-Dollar (etwa 87,7 Milliarden Euro). Das ist ein Plus von 0,7 Prozent gegenüber Dezember und der elfte Wachstumsmonat in Folge. Aber das bedeutet nicht, dass die Stimmung gut ist. 97 Prozent der Restaurantbesitzer sind laut einer Umfrage der National Restaurant Association besorgt über höhere Lebensmittelkosten. 38 Proent geben an, dass sie im vergangenen Jahr kein Geld verdient haben. Das sind eine Menge Habenichtse.

In einer Zeit, in der die Lebensmittelpreise bestenfalls schwanken und Arbeitskräfte schwer zu finden sind, muss der Großteil des Gaststättengewerbes harte Entscheidungen treffen. Wie Corey Mintz in dieser Publikation argumentierte, hassen wir, was nötig ist, um die Restaurants zu retten — mehr Selbstbedienung, höhere Preise. Aber wir haben vielleicht keine andere Wahl. Es ist mir egal, wie oft der Nasdaq neue Höchststände erklimmt. Das sorgt nicht für gute Stimmung.

Das letzte Goldene Zeitalter der Stadt war ebenso eine Zeit des Wachstums und der Vitalität wie eine Zeit der Korruption und Ungleichheit.

Die Restaurants sind knapp bei Kasse, zum Teil, weil auch ihre Gäste knapp bei Kasse sind. Ja, der Rest des Landes beginnt zu sehen, was New York City erlebt hat: Das Schlimmste ist vorbei. Der Verbraucherstimmungsindex der University of Michigan hat sich in den letzten zwei Monaten deutlich verbessert. Die Inflationsaussichten verbessern sich auch weiter. Das sind fantastische Nachrichten für das Land. Aber wie die Analysten von UBS in einer kürzlich veröffentlichten Kundenmitteilung feststellten, heißt das nicht, dass wir uns unbedingt gut fühlen, nur weil es uns nicht schlecht geht.

„Dies sind ermutigende Entwicklungen und die Stimmung dürfte sich weiter verbessern, wenn die Desinflation fortschreitet, die Fed die Zinsen senkt und die Realeinkommen weiter steigen“, schreiben die UBS-Analysten. Kurz gesagt: Die Stimmungskonjunktur für die breite Öffentlichkeit mag vorbei sein, aber die Stimmung hat noch einen langen Weg vor sich.

Korruption und Ungleichheit

Inflation schmerzt jeden. Aber sie ist katastrophal für Menschen, die gerade so über die Runden kommen — oder gerade erst anfangen, ein bisschen zu sparen. In einem äußerst peinlichen Interview schien der CEO von WK Kellogg, Gary Pilnick, begeistert zu sein, als er sagte, dass die Müsli-für-das-Abendessen-Botschaft seines Unternehmens „wirklich gut ankommt“.

„Müsli zum Abendessen ist etwas, das jetzt wahrscheinlich mehr im Trend liegt, und wir erwarten, dass es sich fortsetzt, da der Verbraucher unter Druck steht“, sagte er. Seit 1978 sind die Gehälter der Vorstandsvorsitzenden um 1460 Prozent in die Höhe geschnellt, vor allem dank der aktienbasierten Vergütung. Wenn die Preise drastisch steigen, sehen und spüren das diejenigen, die es sich leisten können, aber sie fühlen es nicht. Diejenigen, die es sich nicht leisten können, versüßen offenbar Gary Pilnick den Tag.

Wenn eine Pandemie New York City und sein Nachtleben nicht besiegen kann, wird es eine kleine Inflation sicher auch nicht tun. Was sie jedoch tun wird, ist die strukturellen Schwächen unserer Gesellschaft aufzudecken. Das letzte Goldene Zeitalter der Stadt war sowohl eine Zeit des Wachstums und der Vitalität als auch eine Zeit der Korruption und Ungleichheit. Es war eine Warnung für diese Stadt und das ganze Land. Auch die Beobachtung der Inflation nach der Pandemie ist eine Warnung. Sie zeigte, wie es aussieht, wenn die amerikanische Wirtschaft einen kurzen, heftigen Schock erlebt. Und das sieht dann so aus, dass die Wohlhabenden in New York City Kaviar essen und die ärmeren Amerikaner Müsli essen.
