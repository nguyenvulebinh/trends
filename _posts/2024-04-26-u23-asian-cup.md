Khuat Van Khang's freekick and Nguyen Van Tung's flick were selected by the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) as among the best goals in the 2024 U23 Asian Cup group stage.

Van Khang's masterful freekick took place in the 39th minute of the 2-0 win over Malaysia, in the second game of group D.

From a distance of about 25 yards, the Vietnamese midfielder surprised everyone by not aiming for the near post but to the far corner instead, scoring a belter.

"Just when the game looked like it was heading to half-time goalless, Khuat Van Khang came up with the solution for Vietnam, his sweet left foot strike sending his free-kick into the top corner past Malaysian goalkeeper Azim Al Amin," AFC wrote.

Khang said that in addition to regular practice, there was also support from goalkeeper Quan Van Chuan.

"Van Chuan told me to pay attention to the goalkeeper's movements before taking a freekick. If they go for the near post, I will shoot the other way," Khang told the media before a training session on Wednesday. "I had a good freekick against Malaysia thanks to that advice."

Khang, 21, is a prominent young talent in Vietnamese football. In 2022, he played for the U19, U20, U23 and national team.

Vietnam's second goal selected by the AFC was Nguyen Van Tung's finish with the outside of his right foot against Kuwait in the opening game.

"A goal worthy to break any deadlock, Nguyen Van Truong’s defense-splitting pass took three Kuwaiti defenders out of the equation and Nguyen Van Tung timed his run to perfection to finish nonchalantly with the outside of his foot," AFC wrote.

Tung, 23, is playing for Hanoi FC. The striker is not good at dribbling but has a knack for goals. He is the first scorer for the U23 team in three major tournaments, the 2022, 2024 U23 Asian Cup and SEA Games 32.

In addition to Vietnam's two goals, AFC also selected six other bangers in the U23 Asian Cup group stage, by striker Ahmed Al Rawi (Qatar, vs Indonesia), as well as goals by defenders Ruslan Khailoev (Tajikistan, vs Saudi Arabia), Aiman Yahya (Saudi Arabia, vs Tajikistan), Abdullah Al Yazidi (Qatar, vs Jordan), Alibek Davronov (Uzbekistan, vs Kuwait) and Witan Sulaeman (Indonesia, vs Jordan).
