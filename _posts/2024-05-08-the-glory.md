Also in late April, 2 athletes Le Van Tinh and Le Minh Thuan are part of the national team to compete at the Southeast Asian Championship in Thailand.

Hue Karatedo holds the predominant position in the Central Region and Central Highlands

Deserving the regional top

It comes as no surprise when the leading name is Thua Thien Hue Karatedo. At the 10th Central Region - Central Highlands Karatedo Championship in 2024, which has just ended in March, the Thua Thien Hue Karatedo team claimed 11 golds, 6 silvers, and 14 bronzes. This tournament brought together 350 athletes from 17 delegations of provinces and cities in the Central Region - Central Highlands, competing in 74 events of age groups.

11 gold medals of Thua Thien Hue Karatedo that deserve to be named are Tran Le Minh Quan (male individual kata, ages 10 - 11), Nguyen Minh Nhat (male individual kata, ages 12 - 14), Truong Huu Nhat Minh (male individual kata, ages 15-17), Nguyen Thi Thuy Trang (female individual kata, ages 15-17), Truong Huu Nhat Minh - Nguyen Hoang Nam - Nguyen Thanh Luan - Le Nguyen Thai Huy (male team kata, ages 15 - 17), Nguyen Hong Duc (male individual kumite, ages 15 - 17), Pham Dinh Son - Le Nguyen Thai Hung - Tran Duc Thai - Ho Dinh Thuan (male team kata, over 18 years old), Tran Viet Duy Quan (over-74kg class, over 18), Ho Dinh Thuan (82kg class, over 18), Le Minh Thuan (over-82kg class, over 18), Ho Thi Hoai Tan (47kg class, over 18).

Since the first tournament was held in Thua Thien Hue in 2016 and then rotated annually in different provinces and cities in the region, whether as a guest or host, the Thua Thien Hue Karatedo representatives affirmed their top position. This achievement also provides the basis for Thua Thien Hue Karatedo to keep striving at higher-class tournaments in the long term.

Hope and wait

It is no coincidence that Thua Thien Hue Karatedo has the position of "tycoon" in the Central Region and Central Highlands. This land is known as Vietnam's cradle of the martial art from the rising sun land. Hue Karatedo once had many outstanding faces on the national team and brought the Fatherland honorable medals. We can mention Nguyen Thi Thao Quyen, then Le Van Loc, Ha Kieu Trang, Bui Tien Thanh, and recently Le Minh Thuan.

Le Minh Thuan from Loc Dien (Phu Loc) was the very boxer who quenched the thirst for "gold" for 14 years since kickboxer Ha Kieu Trang won a gold medal at the 2003 SEA Games. Back then, he was a member of the national men's team, who clinched a gold at the 29th SEA Games in 2018.

Despite not repeating that achievement in recent years, Le Minh Thuan shows that he is worthy of being the hope of the Ancient Capital's Karatedo. Along with Le Van Tinh, Le Minh Thuan will play for the national team at the Southeast Asian Championship in Thailand from April 24 to 27. Against the other athletes, Le Minh Thuan's difference is that his height is rare, and he knows how to make the most of this advantage. Thuan also has an iron will, indescribable passion, and a thirst for contribution. Such was the comment made by sensei Le Van Loc about his favorite student.

Apart from Le Van Tinh and Le Minh Thuan, Thua Thien Hue Karatedo also pins great hopes on Ho Thi Hoai Thanh, Ho Dinh Thuan, and Tran Viet Duy Quan. Karate girl Ho Thi Hoai Thanh from A Luoi Highlands is the defending champion of the Karatedo Tournament at the 9th National Sports Games in 2022.

Besides, Ho Dinh Thuan notched up a gold at the 2018 National Sports Games, a silver at the 2019 Southeast Asia Champion, a gold at the 2020 National Cup, and a bronze at the 9th National Sports Games in 2022. Of course, it would be a mistake to miss Tran Viet Duy Quan, a silver medalist at the 9th National Sports Games in 2022.

Huge investment in Karatedo needed

In conversation with us, many times Coach Le Van Loc in charge of provincial Karatedo expressed concern over the regime and policies for sports athletes in general and Karatedo kickboxers in particular.

Also according to Mr. Loc, along with wrestling, athletics, chess, taekwondo, and swimming-diving, Karatedo in Thua Thien Hue Province is identified as a key group 1 sport that needs investment in the immediate period. Recently, no breakthrough achievements notwithstanding, Thua Thien Hue Karatedo has built a team of experienced coaches and a force of successive and potential athletes.

Against many other sports including sports in group 1, Karatedo remains outstanding when Thua Thien Hue is known as the cradle of this sport. Therefore, huge attention and strong strategic investment policies are needed to bring the strengths and tradition of Karatedo into play like some other sports.
